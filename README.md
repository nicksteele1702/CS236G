# CS236G

The baselines can be ran in the notebooks 236-baseline and 236G for the 3 year and 5 year  price data baselines and 236-2017_baseline for the 2017 earnings call price only baseline.  The best final model and performance evaluation can be ran in the notebook best_model.  'data/master_features.txt' contains the combined audio and text features for earnings calls. Note that portfolio performance evaluation is only set up for the best final model and 2017 price only baseline.  The audio and text feature extracton and data processing can be found in 'audio_features.ipynb' and 'text+VADER+finBERT.ipynb' respectively.  The historical average and LSGAN implementations can be found in '236G-loss_function_H_A.ipynb' and '236G-loss_function_ls.ipynb' respectively.  The other notebooks are various trials of failed runs and other architectures.
